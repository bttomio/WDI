# Collect and use open access World Bank data to know your country

This repository was created to build my presentation for the
[R in Grenoble 2020 Working Sessions](https://r-in-grenoble.github.io/sessions.html).

It's a presentation on how to use the ```WDI``` package. More information
about the package on its [website](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/WDI/).
