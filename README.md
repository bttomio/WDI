# Collect and use open access World Bank data to know your country

This repository was created to build my presentation for the
[R in Grenoble 2020 Working Sessions](https://r-in-grenoble.github.io/sessions.html).

It's a presentation on how to use the ```WDI``` package. More information
about the package on its [website](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/WDI/).

# Script files

1. ```Hands-on.Rmd```: Introduction
2. ```Worlds maps.Rmd```*: Examples of the use of World Bank data with the package
```rnaturalearth```
3. ```Hans Rosling’s Gapminder.Rmd```*: Other examples to mimetize known graphics

(*) Based on the examples provided by the package ```wbstats``` (available 
[here](http://nset-ornl.github.io/wbstats/index.html)).
